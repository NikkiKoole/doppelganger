Doppelganger
------------

A simple C engine specifically tailored for my own hobby project.
SDL backed featuring basic functionality from the ['lazy foo tutorials'](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/), a [pinch of cage](https://github.com/rlofc/cage) and trying to fit in stuff from [handmade hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) when I can.

SDL2, SDL2_image, inotify-tools (on linux), fswatch (on osx)
